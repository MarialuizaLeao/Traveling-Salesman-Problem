# Traveling-Salesman-Problem
Implementation of three versions of the Traveling Salesman Problem
Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using branch and bound, twice arount the tree and christofides. 
Through tests, experiments and performance analysis, this project explores a classic NP-Complete problem and the tradeoffs between exacts and approximative algorithms.
